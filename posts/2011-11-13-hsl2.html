<p>This post will be a continuation of the content found in Part I. Specifically, this post will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The process of writing a maths essay versus a maths contest</li>
<li>The most important characteristics of an aspiring mathematician</li>
</ul>
<p>Recapping from Part I, I was just taking my first couple steps into rigourous mathematics through an extended essay that was to be written on a mathematical topic independently for the IB program diploma. The only trouble was that I had no idea what to choose for my thesis and I could not depend on my advisor to guide me through picking one because he mainly worked in physics.</p>
<p>The only out-of-high-school mathematics topic that really stuck in my head during that time was Cantor's set theory and cardinality concepts, which was fresh in my mind because I recently attended a workshop on them during my visit to CMS maths camp. Mainly his diagonal argument bijecting the natural numbers to the rational numbers was what really interested me.</p>

<p>Going on this small hunch that this topic could lead to a potential thesis question, I headed down to the library, read set theory books and browsed the internet hoping to come upon something interesting. However, most of the books and content that I did get a hand on was far beyond the scope of what was taught in the high school curriculum, so I did what any reasonable young mathematician would have done. I borrowed some books about how to read mathematics books.</p>
<p>This took about a week to really get the notation and symbols such as <span class="math">
